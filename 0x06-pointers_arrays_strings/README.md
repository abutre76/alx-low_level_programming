# C Programming Language

C programming language is a popular and widely used programming language that was developed in the early 1970s. It is a high-level language, which means it is closer to human language and easier to understand compared to low-level languages like assembly language. C has a simple syntax and a powerful set of features, making it versatile and efficient for a wide range of applications.

C programming language is worth it because of its versatility, efficiency, portability, its influence on other languages, its ability to deepen your understanding of computer architecture, the abundance of resources available, and the career opportunities it offers.
